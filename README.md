## Programming for Data Analytics - Simulating Data Project

This repository contains an assignment which creates a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon.  The data used is based on the capital spend of five Irish universities.  The data used is **not real**.  It is all synthesised to match as closely as possible real data.  This simulated data set has been analysed using a number of python libraries - numpy.random, pandas, seaborn, datetime.  The data set was created using a Jupyter notebook.

The Jupyter notebook contains the following information:<br>
<br>
• Introduction to the Synthesised Data Set<br>
• How the Data Set was created<br>
• An Analysis of the Data Set<br>
• Conclusion - a summary of the analysis and findings. <br>
• References

Below are instructions on how to run this repository:
